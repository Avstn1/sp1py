it generates a professionally tailored resume highlighting the exact skills and experience that match the role, saving you countless hours and boosting your chances of standing out.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Use This?

Hiring managers spend mere seconds scanning each resume. This automation ensures that every word you present is **purpose-built for the job**, highlighting what matters most to recruiters. Instead of generic resumes, youâ€™ll have a laser-focused document that speaks directly to the role â€” making you the obvious candidate.

## ðŸ›  How It Works (Behind the Scenes)

1. You paste a job description into the applicationâ€™s input box.
2. The app sends targeted prompts to OpenAIâ€™s API to generate:
   - A tailored **SKILLS** section with exactly five relevant skills.
   - Customized **experience bullet points** for multiple roles based on your original achievements.
3. These generated texts replace placeholders in your Word resume template (`resume_template.docx`).
4. The updated resume is saved as a new Word document.
5. Optionally, it converts the Word document to PDF, ready to send to employers.
